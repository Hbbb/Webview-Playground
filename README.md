# webview-playground
The purpose of this app is to be able to develop, test and debug mobile advertisements in an isolated UIWebView context. 


## Usage
Paste an ad tag into a text field, click the load preview button, and you will see the ad preview in the next view. Current support is limited to banners (kind of) and expandables.

## TODO
- Add support for loading tags via TagBuilder API
- Fix issue that causes banner to open landing pages inline
- Add more debugging options/something to make this actually useful
